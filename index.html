        <h1>The cat</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
        <br>
        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.</p>Ãº
        <p>The cat eats:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>fish</li>
            <li>mouse</li>
            <li>dry food</li>
            <li>whatever you eat</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Ancient Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated since around 3100 BC. However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was found in Cyprus, where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around 7500 BC. African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East.</p>
        <p>As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish, with 95 million cats owned. In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.</p>
